<h2>What is Bee?</h2>

<p>Bee is a build tool. This means that its purpose is to automate a build
process. Its design goals are:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Clean and simple build file syntax</b>. While XML is too verbose and
Ruby too complicated, <a href="http://www.yaml.org/">YAML</a> is perfect with
its simple yet powerful syntax.</li>
<li><b>Speed</b>. Slow startup are irritating while working with a build
tool the whole day. Bee happens to be as fast as Make, according to my tests
on Make builds ported to Bee.</li>
<li><b>System and language independent</b>. Bee is written in Ruby, which is
platform independent, and is not limited to building Ruby projects. 
Furthermore, using Bee tasks (we'll see later) instead of shell commands is
a way to write build files that would run on any platform.</li>
<li><b>Run Ruby scripts</b>. Because Ruby is so cool, nobody wants to write
anymore intricate shell scripts to code complicated tasks involving sed, grep
with loads of pipes! Just write it in a Ruby script! Nevertheless, you are
free to write shell scripts if you build your project on a single platform.</li>
</ul>

<p>To demonstrate these features, let's see what <i>hello world</i> example
looks like using Bee:</p>

<?include file="exp/quickstart-hello-world.yml" ?>

<p>This is that simple!</p>

<h2>Build properties</h2>

<p>A build file can embed properties that are like variables. For instance,
we can put user name in a property named <i>user_name</i> like this:</p>

<?include file="exp/quickstart-properties-1.yml" ?>

<p>We access the value of this property with a Ruby syntax. Thus, to get
value for property <i>user_name</i>, we must write <tt>#{user_name}</tt>.</p>

<p>In this example, the property value is a string <tt>"World"</tt>.
In fact, this is a Ruby expression that is evaluated to get the value of
the property. Thus, we can write Ruby expressions as value. For instance,
to get the user name, we could write:</p>

<?include file="exp/quickstart-properties-2.yml" ?>

<p>Which could print:</p>

<?bee build="exp/quickstart-properties-2.yml" options="-s ll:80 hello" ?>

<p>Properties may also have integer, list or hash values. You must
then use a YAML syntax to write them, but fortunately, this syntax is
very close to Ruby one:</p>

<?include file="exp/quickstart-properties-3.yml" ?>

<p>This outputs:</p>

<?bee build="exp/quickstart-properties-3.yml" options="-s ll:80 hello" ?>

<p>Bee defines a special property named <i>base</i> which contains
absolute path for build file directory. This is useful for building
absolute file path, such as <tt>license: "#{base}/LICENSE"</tt>. Bee
also stores directory where it was started in property <i>here</i>.
These two properties might differ in some circumstances, for instance
when starting Bee searching recursively build file with command line
argument <tt>-r</tt>. These two property names are reserved for Bee
usage and you can't name your properties <i>base</i> or <i>here</i>.</p>

<p>It is also possible to load properties from a YAML file that contains
a list of properties to set. Just write the file name (absolute or
relative to the directory of the build file) instead of the list of
properties. For instance, to load properties in file <i>numbers.yml</i>:</p>

<?include file="exp/quickstart-properties-4.yml" ?>

<p>Into a build file, you might write:</p>

<?include file="exp/quickstart-properties-5.yml" ?>

<h2>Targets</h2>

<p>If we see build files as programs, we could see targets as functions
that you can call to achieve a given goal. A build file can define more
that one target that may depend on each other. For instance:</p>

<?include file="exp/quickstart-hello-world-2.yml" ?>

<p>Which produces following output:</p>

<?bee build="exp/quickstart-hello-world-2.yml" options="-s ll:80 hello" ?>

<p>Target <i>hello</i> now depends on target <i>capitalize</i> which 
capitalizes <i>user_name</i> property. Thus, Bee runs first target 
<i>capitalize</i>, then target <i>hello</i>.</p>

<p>You can tell Bee to run a given target by passing its name on
command line. For instance, running build file above typing
<tt>bee capitalize</tt> would output:</p>

<?bee build="exp/quickstart-hello-world-2.yml" options="-s ll:80 capitalize" ?>

<p>Which is not much, because target <i>capitalize</i> doesn't output
anything.</p>

<p>When you don't pass any target on command line, Bee selects the
first one as default target. There is a way to force default target
(even if not the first one) by adding build information entry that
indicates default build target:</p>

<?include file="exp/quickstart-hello-world-3.yml" ?>

<p>Which, when launched without specifying any target on command line, 
outputs:</p>

<?bee build="exp/quickstart-hello-world-3.yml" options="-s ll:80" ?>

<h2>Tasks</h2>

<p>If targets are functions, tasks can be seen as instructions. They can
be shell scripts, Ruby code or Bee tasks:</p>

<h3>Shell scripts</h3>

<p>To run a shell script, you just have to put it in a string. Thus,
to print the user's name, we could write:</p>

<pre>- 'echo "Hello $USER!"'</pre>

<p>Note that we can surround YAML strings with simple or double quotes.
We choose simple quotes here so that we can use double for the Shell one.
We could also escape double quotes inside YAML string as follows:</p>

<pre>- "echo \"Hello $USER!\""</pre>

<p>If return value of the script is not <i>0</i>, which denotes an
error running the script, the build is interrupted and an error message
is printed on the console. For instance, this script:</p>

<?include file="exp/quickstart-broken-shell.yml" ?>

<p>Will produce this output on the console:</p>

<?bee build="exp/quickstart-broken-shell.yml" options="-s ll:80 broken" ?>

<p>There are convenient ways to write shell scripts:</p>

<?include file="exp/quickstart-convenient-shell.yml" ?>

<p>First, when a target embeds a single shell script, we can write it
just after the <tt>script</tt> key. Second, a multi line shell scripts
can be written using pipe character (<i>|</i>).</p>

<h3>Ruby scripts</h3>

<p>A Ruby script must be preceded with <tt>rb</tt> key, such as in
example bellow:</p>

<?include file="exp/quickstart-ruby.yml" ?>

<p>Which outputs:</p>

<?bee build="exp/quickstart-ruby.yml" options="-s ll:80 ruby" ?>

<p>It is also possible to use YAML <i>pipe</i> syntax for multi line Ruby 
scripts.</p>

<h3>Bee tasks</h3>

<p>These tasks are written in Ruby and can be called with pure YAML syntax,
as follows:</p>

<?include file="exp/quickstart-bee-task.yml" ?>

<p>As you might guess, <tt>print</tt> Bee task prints the string passed as 
parameter on the console, and this build file outputs as expected:</p>

<?bee build="exp/quickstart-bee-task.yml" options="-s ll:80 hello" ?>

<h3>Control structures</h3>

<p>Bee is not a programming language, but it enables you to control the
tasks execution with control structures. There is a <code>if-then-else</code>
construct that works this way:</p>

<?include file="exp/quickstart-if.yml" ?>

<p>You can also loop while a condition is met, using the <code>while-do</code>
construct:</p>

<?include file="exp/quickstart-while.yml" ?>

<p>The last construct if <code>for-in-do</code> which will iterate over a
list (a plain list or a Ruby expression evaluated as an Enumerable). For
instance, to iterate over the files in the current directory, you might 
write:</p>

<?include file="exp/quickstart-for.yml" ?>

<p>Finally, <code>try-catch</code> consruct helps manage errors. For instance,
if you want to know if a given command exists, you might write:</p>

<?include file="exp/quickstart-try.yml" ?>

<p>Note that while not tasks, you can get help about these constructs the
same way you get help about tasks (as seen hereafter).</p>

<h2>Getting help</h2>

<p>To get help on Bee command line arguments, type <tt>bee -h</tt>, which
will print:</p>

<?bee options="-h ll:80 hello" ?>

<p>To get help about a build file, type <tt>bee -b</tt>. This will output
the build name and description, property names and values, target names
and description and default target:</p>

<?bee build="exp/quickstart-hello-world-3.yml"  options="-b -s ll:80 hello" ?>

<p>To get help on a given task, use <tt>-k</tt> option. For instance, to
get help about <i>print</i> task, type <tt>bee -k print</tt>, which would
output:</p>

<?bee options="-k print -s ll:80 hello" ?>

<p>You can find documentation about all standard tasks 
<a href="tasksreference.html">on this page</a>.</p>

<h2>Go further</h2>

<p>Bee has much more to offer, including build inheritance, scaffoldings and
many more features detailed in the <a href="userguide.html">User Guide</a>.
After playing a while with Bee, you should read it to get more from it.</p>

<p><i>Enjoy!</i></p>
