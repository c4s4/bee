<p>This file is the reference documentation for bee users. For a 
short introduction to bee, please see <a href="quickstart.html">Quick
Start</a> documentation.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Bee is written in Ruby, thus a Ruby Virtual Machine
must be installed to run it. You can get one for free at 
<a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">http://www.ruby-lang.org</a>.
You must also install <a href="http://docs.rubygems.org/">RubyGems</a>
to install Bee and its dependencies.</p>

<p>When Ruby and Gems are both installed, you can install Bee and its
dependencies typing <tt>gem install bee</tt>. You might need 
administrator privileges to do so. You can test your installation
typing <code>bee -h</code>.</p>

<p>Bee has been tested on MacOSX (Tiger 10.4.11 and Leopard 1.5.6), 
Linux (Ubuntu 7.10 and Mint Helena) and Windows (XP SP2) for Ruby versions
1.8.6-p36 (with gems 0.9.4), 1.8.6-p111 (with gems 1.0.1), 
1.8.6-p114 (with gems 1.0.1), 1.8.7-p72 (with gems 1.3.0) and
1.9.1-p376 (with integrated Gems). Thus it should run on most modern
operating systems and Ruby VMs.</p>

<p>If you have trouble installing Ruby VMs and Gems, please refer 
to <a href="compiling.html">Compiling Bee</a> page for more information
on these topics.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>To run a build, type <tt>bee</tt>. This will run default target,
that is the one specified in <tt>default</tt> key of the <tt>build</tt>
entry. To run another target, pass its name on the command line. Thus,
to run target <i>foo</i>, type <tt>bee foo</tt>. You can run more than one
target at once, passing their name. Typing <tt>bee foo bar</tt> will run 
target <i>foo</i>, then target <i>bar</i> (even if it was already executed
running <i>foo</i>).</p>

<p>Let's consider following build file:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-build.yml"?>

<p>Running build with command <tt>bee</tt> will run target <i>all</i>
(default one) and produce following output:</p>

<?run command="bee -s ll:80 -f exp/userguide-build.yml"
      print="bee"?>

<p>This output indicates running targets (<i>capitalize</i> and 
<i>hello</i> in this case). Terminating <i>OK</i> indicates that
no error was met and thus build is OK. If an error occurs, build
ends with an error message and <tt>bee</tt> process exits with
an error value.</p>

<p>Build file name defaults to <i>build.yml</i> in current directory.
You may override this default value using <tt>-f file</tt> option.
Thus, to run build file <i>other.yml</i>, type <tt>bee -f other.yml</tt>.
You can also look for build file recursively in file system using
<tt>-r</tt> option. So, typing <tt>bee -r</tt> will look for build
file named <i>build.yml</i> in current directory. If no build file
was found, it will look in parent directories recursively. Build fails
if no build file was found. You can use <tt>-r</tt> and <tt>-f file</tt>
options at the same time to search an alternate file recursively.</p>

<p>To produce verbose output running builds, use <tt>-v</tt> option.
This will write build file used, executed tasks and execution time.
Furthermore, this will output a stack trace (in addition to standard
error message) when an error takes place, which is useful to debug
Bee itself. Running previous build with verbose output would print:</p>

<?run command="bee -v -s ll:80 -f exp/userguide-build.yml"
      print="bee -v"?>

<p>The <tt>-n</tt> option produces the same verbose output but
doesn't actually runs tasks, it just prints them.</p>

<p>To print help on usage, type <tt>bee -h</tt>. This outputs:</p>

<?run command="bee -h"?>

<p>To print help on build file, use <tt>-b</tt> option. This will output
build name and description, property names and values, target names and
descriptions and default target. For our sample build file, this will
print:</p>

<?run command="bee -b -s ll:80 -f exp/userguide-build.yml"
      print="bee -b"?>

<p>To get help on a given task, type <tt>bee -k task</tt>. Thus, to get
help about <tt>print</tt> task for instance, you would type:</p>

<?run command="bee -k print -s ll:80 -f exp/userguide-build.yml"
      print="bee -k print"?>

<p>To get help about all tasks, type <tt>bee -k ?</tt>. To get help
about all tasks in package <i>foo</i>, type <tt>bee -k foo.?</tt>.</p>

<p>To get help on templates, use the <tt>-e template</tt> option, with
the same joker syntax than for task help. Thus, to get help about the
<i>package</i> template, type <tt>bee -e package</tt>, which will
output:</p>

<?run command="bee -e package print -s ll:80 -f exp/userguide-build.yml"
      print="bee -e package"?>

<p>You can run a given template using option <tt>-t template</tt>.
Templates are a way to quickly start a new project from scratch. They
are quite comparable to Rails scaffoldings. For more information on
using and developing templates, please see section
<a href="developerguide.html#Template%20Project">Template Project of
Developer Guide</a>.</p>

<p>You can set text properties on command line with option
<tt>-p foo=bar</tt>, setting property <i>foo</i> with value <i>"bar"</i>.
You can set more than one property this way. For instance, launching
following empty build file with command line 
<tt>bee -b -p foo=1 bar=2</tt>:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-command-line-properties.yml"?>

<p>Will output:</p>

<?run command="bee -s ll:80 -b -f exp/userguide-command-line-properties.yml -p foo=1 -p bar=2"
      print="bee -b -p foo=1 -p bar=2"?>

<p>When you run bee in a color terminal (such as the Terminal application
on MacOSX or XTerm on Linux), you can get a colorized output using
<tt>-c</tt> command line option. This will use the standard color scheme
for bee. To customize your output, you can apply a style to output using
<tt>-s style</tt> option. In the terminal bellow, we run a build with
default black and white style and then applying the default color style:</p>

<center><img src="userguide-style.png"></center>

<p>Style are applied outputting ANSI colors and styles for Unix terminals
and thus won't run on Windows machines. Styles are defined as coma separated
key/value pairs. Keys are the following:</p>

<table>
<tr>
<th>Key</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>lc</b></td>
<td>Character for target title (defaults to dash <i>-</i>). To set space,
set to an empty value, such as: <code>...,lc:,...</code> as there should
not be spaces in style option (this would break command line parsing).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>ll</b></td>
<td>Line length. If not set, will try to determine it calling IOCTL
function. If this call fails, will set line length to <i>80</i>
characters.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>ts</b></td>
<td>Target style.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>tf</b></td>
<td>Target foreground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>tb</b></td>
<td>Target background.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>ks</b></td>
<td>Task style.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>kf</b></td>
<td>Task foreground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>kb</b></td>
<td>Task background.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>ss</b></td>
<td>Success style.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>sf</b></td>
<td>Success foreground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>sb</b></td>
<td>Success background.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>es</b></td>
<td>Error style.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>ef</b></td>
<td>Error foreground.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>eb</b></td>
<td>Error background.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Possible foreground and background colors are the following ones: 
black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white. Styles are
the following ones: bright, dim, underscore, blink, reverse and hidden.
</p>

<p>If a given key is not set, it will keep its default value. The Bee
options environment variable <code>BEEOPT</code> is the best place
to set you style settings (see section 
<a href="#Configuration">Configuration</a> hereafter). Note that you
can force black and white output using the <tt>-w</tt> options. This
is useful to run bee in a software that doesn't manage ANSI color codes
while color is set in your <tt>BEEOPT</tt> environment variable.</p>

<p>You can print the Bee logo on command line with option <tt>-l</tt>:</p>

<?run command="bee -l -s ll:80 -f exp/userguide-build.yml"
      print="bee -l"?>

<p>On Unix platforms, you can enable Bee completion in the terminal. To do so,
you must copy the script <i>bash_completion_bee</i> (that you will find in the
<i>bin</i> directory of the gem, use commands <tt>sudo updatedb</tt> and
<tt>locate bash_completion_bee</tt> to locate it in your file system) or
download it from <a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/74229/bash_completion_bee">http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/74229/bash_completion_bee</a>) in directory <i>/etc/bash_completion.d/</i>, rename it <i>bee</i> and make
it executable (with command <tt>sudo chmod +x /etc/bash_completion.d/bee</tt>).
</p>

<p>Then add the following lines in your shell startup file (that is <i>~/.profile</i>,
<i>~/.bashrc</i> or such a configuration file):</p>

<pre>
# Bee completion
. /etc/bash_completion.d/bee
</pre>

<p>Next time you open a terminal, completion should
have been enabled for long options (starting with --), build target names,
help about tasks and templates:</p>

<pre class='term'>
$ bee --help[TAB]
--help           --help-build     --help-task      --help-template

$ bee t[TAB]
tag   test

$ bee -k c[TAB]
cat    cd     chmod  chown  copy   cp

$ bee -e s[TAB]
script   sinatra  source
</pre>

<p>On MacOSX, bash doesn't have completion feature out of the box. Thus, you 
will have to install bash_completion yourself. You may use 
<a href="http://www.finkproject.org/">Fink</a> (typing <tt>fink install 
bash-completion</tt>) or <a href="http://www.macports.org/">MacPorts</a> 
(typing <tt>port install bash_completion</tt>) for that purpose. To get
more information about installation bash_completion on MacOSX, please
visit 
<a href="http://mult.ifario.us/p/getting-bash-completion-magic-on-os-x">this
page</a>.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>Bee doesn't load configuration file at startup, but you can set
command line options in environment variable <code>BEEOPT</code> that
is appended on command line at startup. For instance, setting:</p>

<pre>BEEOPT="-v"</pre>

<p>Would always run Bee in verbose mode.</p>

<h2>Build files</h2>

<p>Let's consider following simple build file:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-build.yml"?>

<p>This is a <a href="http://www.yaml.org/">YAML</a> file and thus 
follows standard YAML syntax. We won't detail the YAML syntax hereafter
but instead see a useful subset to write Bee build files.</p>

<h3>Build file syntax</h3>

<p>You might think of YAML as a data aware text file format. Let's
see a grocery list in YAML:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-yaml-list.yml"?>

<p>Let's write a short Ruby script that would load this file and print
loaded data:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-yaml-loader.rb"?>

<p>Let's run this script passing our grocery list on command line:</p>

<?run command="ruby userguide-yaml-loader.rb userguide-yaml-list.yml" 
      directory="exp"?>

<p>We see that the script loads this file as a Ruby list of strings.
Thus, writing a list with dashes (as we would do for our grocery list)
results in a list while loaded.</p>

<p>Let's write a list with associated quantities:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-yaml-hash.yml"?>

<p>Let's run our script on this file:</p>

<?run command="ruby userguide-yaml-loader.rb userguide-yaml-hash.yml" 
      directory="exp"?>

<p>This results in a Ruby Hash! Note that there are short syntax for
list and hash, that happens to be very close to Ruby (and Python) syntax:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-yaml-short-list-hash.yml"?>

<p>But YAML is also aware of data types: in our hash, strings are
associated to integers. When we write an integer, YAML parser recognizes
it and returns an integer instead of a string. YAML is also aware of
floats, booleans, dates and symbols. For instance:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-yaml-data-types.yml"?>

<p>Would be parsed as:</p>

<?run command="ruby userguide-yaml-loader.rb userguide-yaml-data-types.yml" 
      directory="exp"?>

<p>You might wonder how we can write string <tt>123</tt> as it would be
recognized as an integer. In this case, you can force string type using
quotes, writing <tt>"123"</tt>. The form without quotes is a convenient
way to write YAML strings. Note also that <i>null</i> is parsed into 
<tt>nil</tt> and thus is not a valid name for targets.</p>

<p>Now, you might ask how to nest a structure within another one. This is
done with indentation. For instance, to write a list within another one,
you might write:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-yaml-nested-list.yml"?>

<p>This will be parsed into:</p>

<?run command="ruby userguide-yaml-loader.rb userguide-yaml-nested-list.yml" 
      directory="exp"?>

<p>Here is hash nested in a list:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-yaml-nested-hash.yml"?>

<p>That will be parsed into:</p>

<?run command="ruby userguide-yaml-loader.rb userguide-yaml-nested-hash.yml" 
      directory="exp"?>

<p>This YAML syntax is very powerful, yet simple. This enables to write
complicated data structures in a human readable form. We'll now see
how it is used to write build files.</p>

<p>A build file is a list of entries. An entry might be of the following
type:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Information</b>: this is a hash that gives general
  information about the build (such as its name or default target).</li>
  <li><b>Properties</b>: this is a hash for build properties.</li>
  <li><b>Targets</b>: this is the list of build targets.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's detail each entry type.</p>

<h3>Build information</h3>

<p>Let's see a sample build information entry:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-build-info.yml"?>

<p>This entry is a hash with following keys:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>build</b>: this mandatory key gives the build name (which will
  generally be the name of the project to build).</li>
  <li><b>extends</b>: parent build file(s) to extends. See section
  <a href="#Build inheritance">Build inheritance</a> for more information
  on this topic.</li>
  <li><b>abstract</b>: tells if this build file is abstract, which means
  that it must be extended to run. This entry is optional and defaults to
  <tt>false</tt>.</li>
  <li><b>default</b>: this optional key is the default target (or a list of
  default targets), that is the target(s) to run when no target is given on
  the command line. If there is no such entry, you must pass target to run
  on the command line.</li>
  <li><b>alias</b>: aliases for targets, as a map that associates an alias
  to a target or a list of targets. Note that aliases are valid target
  names when passed on command line or listed in <i>default</i> entry,
  but they are not existing targets. Thus, you can't depend on them from
  another target for instance.</li>
  <li><b>description</b>: this optional key describes the build.</li>
  <li><b>context</b>: this optional key is a file (or list of files)
  to load in the build context (see <a href="#Build context">Build 
  context</a> section hereafter for more information). This path might
  be absolute or relative to the build file directory.</li>
</ul>

<p>This entry is optional but you can't have two of them in a given
build file.</p>

<h3>Build properties</h3>

<p>This is a hash of build properties, such as in this build file:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-build-properties.yml"?>

<p>Properties are a hash made of name / value pairs. The name must be a 
valid Ruby variable name and must not collide with a function in the Ruby
context. For instance, following build file:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-build-properties-error.yml"?>

<p>Will result in a parsing error because evaluating Ruby expression
<tt>12three = 123</tt> will output:</p>

<?run command="ruby -e '12three = 123'" error="true"?>

<p>While loading build file, properties are evaluated as Ruby expressions
in the build context. Thus, a property such as <tt>foo: 123</tt> will
result in evaluating <tt>foo = 123</tt> in the build context.</p>

<p>Strings are also evaluated as Ruby strings, thus they can refer to
other variables (using Ruby <tt>#{variable}</tt> syntax), or any Ruby
expression, such as in this build file:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-build-properties-expressions.yml"?>

<p>Will output:</p>

<?run command="bee -s ll:80 -f exp/userguide-build-properties-expressions.yml test"
      print="bee test"?>

<p>You can refer to another variable using symbol notation. For instance,
in this build file:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-build-properties-symbol.yml"?>

<p>We refer to value of build property <tt>foo</tt> using symbol
<tt>:foo</tt> instead of using the string evaluation. The result is
the same for strings but not for other property types.</p>

<p>Property values are not limited to strings. You might assign any
YAML data type to a build property. This might be useful when
using these properties in Ruby scripts or Bee tasks that expect
a given type (such as lists for instance).</p>

<p>It is also possible to load properties from a YAML file containing
a list of properties to set. You would define such a properties file
as following:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-properties.yml"?>

<p>You would load these properties such as in:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-properties-build.yml"?>

<p>You give the absolute or relative (to the build file directory) path
to the properties file. Printing help on this build file would output:</p>

<?run command="bee -s ll:80 -b -f exp/userguide-properties-build.yml"
      print="bee -b"?> 

<p>Which shows that properties we define in our YAML properties file
were set in the build context.</p>

<p>Note that if you define a given property twice in your build file, the
last value will be kept. Properties you pass on command line (with option
<tt>-p</tt>) overwrite build file properties and are defined after
build file loading.</p>

<h3>Default properties</h3>

<p>When running, Bee automatically defines two properties:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>base</b> which is the directory of the build file.</li>
<li><b>here</b> that is the directory where Bee was started.</li>
</ul>

<p>Following build file:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-build-property-base.yml"?>

<p>Outputs (depending of the directory you're running script into):</p>

<?run command="bee -s ll:80 -f exp/userguide-build-property-base.yml defaults"
      print="bee defaults"?>

<p>These properties are useful to get an absolute path for a file in
your project. For instance, absolute path for file <i>lib/bee.rb</i>
relatively to your build file may be obtained with property 
<tt>abs_path = "#{base}/lib/bee.rb"</tt>. Note that <i>base</i> and
<i>here</i> might have different values. Furthermore, these two
property names are reserved for Bee usage and you can't name your
own properties <i>base</i> or <i>here</i>.</p>

<h3>Build targets</h3>

<p>A build target is a hash with following keys:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>target</b>: mandatory key that defines the target name.</li>
  <li><b>depends</b>: a target (or list of targets) this target depends
  on (optional).</li>
  <li><b>description</b>: description of the target purpose (optional).</li>
  <li><b>script</b>: list of tasks to run to perform this target
  (optional).</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a sample build file with two targets:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-build-target.yml"?>

<p>This will output:</p>

<?run command="bee -s ll:80 -f exp/userguide-build-target.yml test"
      print="bee test"?>

<p>It runs first target <i>test</i> as there is no default target
(no build information entry is defined) and target <i>test</i> is
the first one of this build file. But this target depends on
<i>hello</i>, thus it runs <i>hello</i> then <i>test</i>. You can
tell Bee to run a given target passing its name on the command
line. Thus, to run target <i>hello</i>, you can type:</p>

<?run command="bee -s ll:80 -f exp/userguide-build-target.yml hello"
      print="bee hello"?>

<p>Note that you can't define two targets with the same name. If so,
Bee will complain about duplicate target definition.</p>

<p><tt>depends</tt> key may also be a list. In this case, all
depending targets will run first. Note that a given target won't
run twice, if already executed, it will be skipped.</p>

<p><tt>script</tt> key is a task or list of tasks to run to 
perform this target. A task may be:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Shell Task</b>: This is a shell script that will be executed
  in directory of the build file.</li>
  <li><b>Ruby Task</b>: This is a Ruby script that will be evaluated
  in the context of the build in the directory of the build file.</li>
  <li><b>Bee Task</b>: This is a task written in Ruby that can be
  called using a YAML syntax.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Shell tasks</h4>

<p>Shell tasks are shell scripts in strings. For instance, to output
<i>Hello World!</i>, one might write:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-shell-hello.yml"?>

<p>Each shell script runs in its own process, thus following build
file:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-shell-multi.yml"?>

<p>Might not output what you expect:</p>

<?run command="bee -s ll:80 -f exp/userguide-shell-multi.yml test"
      print="bee test"?>

<p>This is because second line of script runs in another process than
the first one, thus it doesn't old any value for environment variable
<tt>WHO</tt>. To implement expected behavior, you should write:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-shell-multi-fixed.yml"?>

<p>Which will define the script in a single string and run it in a 
single process, keeping value you assigned to the environment variable
and thus behave as expected:</p>

<?run command="bee -s ll:80 -f exp/userguide-shell-multi-fixed.yml test"
      print="bee test"?>

<p>You can access build properties in shell scripts using the Ruby
notation:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-shell-property.yml"?>

<p>While running a shell script, Bee replaces strings <i>#{expression}</i>
with the result of the expression evaluation in the build context. Thus,
you can use a Ruby expression instead of a simple string reference. For
instance, to get the uppercase value of string <i>who</i>, one might
write:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-shell-property-ruby.yml"?>

<p>This will output:</p>

<?run command="bee -s ll:80 -f exp/userguide-shell-property-ruby.yml test"
      print="bee test"?>

<p>These shell tasks are convenient, but you should keep in
mind that they bind your build with a given operating system.
To make your build independent of any platform or OS, you should
use instead Ruby or Bee tasks we'll see now.</p>

<h4>Ruby Tasks</h4>

<p>They are pieces of Ruby scripts embedded in your build file and
evaluated in the build context. In this context live build properties
and scripts you loaded in the build context using the <tt>context</tt>
key of the <tt>build</tt> entry of the build file (see section 
<a href="#Build context">Build context</a> hereafter for more details).</p>

<p>For instance, to print the list of targets for a given build file,
one might write following build file:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-ruby.yml"?>

<p>That will print:</p>

<?run command="bee -s ll:80 -f exp/userguide-ruby.yml print"
      print="bee print"?>

<p>Note that when we change directory in a given Ruby task, this
directory will stay current one until the end of the current target.
Furthermore, you can access build properties because they are local
variables for your Ruby script. The same way, all local variables
you define in your script are build properties. Thus, you must be
careful to avoid collisions with properties, using prefixed names
for local variables you don't want to expose as properties, such
as <tt>_foo</tt>.</p>

<p>Ruby tasks are not the right place for long ruby scripts because
you are writing these scripts in a YAML file, you won't probably benefit
from your editor's facilities for editing Ruby files. Furthermore,
long Ruby tasks may make your build files less readable. Thus, you
should put long ruby scripts in a separate Ruby source file and
load it in the <tt>context</tt> key of the <tt>build</tt> entry of
your build file.</p>

<h4>Bee tasks</h4>

<p>These tasks are coded in Ruby and called using a YAML syntax. We
have already seen <tt>print</tt> task that prints a message on the
console:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-bee-task.yml"?>

<p>This will output:</p>

<?run command="bee -s ll:80 -f exp/userguide-bee-task.yml hello"
      print="bee hello"?>

<p>There are Bee tasks for many common tasks to build a project.
To get help on usage of these tasks, please see 
<a href="tasksreference.html">Tasks Reference</a> section of
the documentation.</p>

<p>These tasks are the best solution to write platform and OS
independent build files. You can write your own tasks in Ruby, see
section <a href="developerguide.html#Writing%20Bee%20Tasks">Writing
Bee Tasks</a> in Developer Guide for more information on this topic.</p>

<h3>Control Structures</h3>

<p>In addition to tasks, a target can include control structures such
as <code>if</code>, <code>while</code> or <code>for</code> to control
tasks execution.</p>

<h4>If construct</h4>

<p><i>If</i> construct will evaluate the Ruby expression in the <code>if</code>
entry and run block in the <code>then</code> entry or <code>else</code>
entry accordingly.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>if</code>: the condition to evaluate. This is a Ruby expression
evaluated in the build context.</li>
<li><code>then</code>: block that is evaluated if confition in if is true.</li>
<li><code>else</code>: block that is evaluated if confition in if is false.</li>
</ul>

<p>For instance, to test hardware platform, you might write:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-if.yml"?>

<p>Which would produce, as expected:</p>

<?run command="bee -s ll:80 -f exp/userguide-if.yml hardware"
      print="bee hardware"?>

<h4>While construct</h4>

<p><i>While</i> construct will run the block in the <code>do</code> entry
while the Ruby condition in the <code>while</code> entry is true.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>while</code>: the condition to evaluate. This is a Ruby expression
evaluated in the build context.</li>
<li><code>do</code>: the block to run while the condition is true.</li>
</ul>

<p>For instance, to iterate five times, you could write:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-while.yml"?>

<p>Which would produce, as expected:</p>

<?run command="bee -s ll:80 -f exp/userguide-while.yml loop"
      print="bee loop"?>

<h4>For construct</h4>

<p><i>For</i> construct iterates on a list in the <code>in</code> entry, 
putting values in a property which name is in the <code>for</code> entry
and running the block in the <code>do</code> entry for each value.</p>

<ul>
<li><code>for</code>: the name of the property which receives values of the
iteration.</li>
<li><code>in</code>: a list on which to iterate. This can be a list or a ruby
expression to evaluate in the context of the build to obtain the Enumerable
on which to iterate.</li>
<li><code>do</code>: the block to run at each iteration.</li>
</ul>

<p>For instance, to iterate on a list of files to create, you could write:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-for1.yml"?>

<p>Which would write on console:</p>

<?run command="bee -s ll:80 -f exp/userguide-for1.yml for"
      print="bee for"?>

<p>In this previous example, the <code>in</code> entry was a list; in this
case, Bee iterates on this list. You can also put a Ruby expression (which 
is a string) in the <code>in</code> entry. Bee will then evaluate this
expression, that must produce an Enumerable, and iterate on it. For instance,
to iterate five times, we could write (using a Ruby Range):</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-for2.yml"?>

<p>Which would output, as expected:</p>

<?run command="bee -s ll:80 -f exp/userguide-for2.yml for"
      print="bee for"?>

<p>To iterate on files in current directory, we could write:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-for3.yml"?>

<h4>Try construct</h4>

<p>This last construct is for error management. It will run the block in the
<code>try</code> entry and catch any error that might occur. If an error
occurs, instead of stopping the build, it will run the block in the
<code>catch</code> entry.</p>

<p>For instance, to test if a given command exists in the system your
building on, you might write:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-try.yml"?>

<p>Which would output, as expected:</p>

<?run command="bee -s ll:80 -f exp/userguide-try.yml test"
      print="bee test"?>

<h4>Getting help</h4>

<p>Note that these constructs are not tasks, but you can get help about
them the same way you get help about tasks. For instance, typing 
<code>bee -k for</code> will print on console help about the 
<code>for</code> construct.</p>

<h4>Dry running control structures</h4>

<p>Control structures won't run in dry mode to avoid any side effect
evaluating Ruby expressions in <code>if</code>, <code>while</code>,
<code>for</code> or <code>in</code> entries. Thus, while running builds
in dry mode, control structure will be printed but tasks inside them won't
as you might expect.</p>

<h2>Build context</h2>

<p>The build context is the place where build properties and Ruby
tasks are evaluated. It can be initialized with Ruby source files
you put in the <tt>context</tt> key of the <tt>build</tt> entry of
your build file.</p>

<p>Let's say you often use a greeting function. You can put it in
a Ruby source file:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-context.rb"?>

<p>You would load it in context with following build file:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-context.yml"?>

<p>When this build file is loaded, it evaluates the Ruby source
in <tt>context</tt> key in the build context. This will define
function <i>say_hello(who)</i> in the context. Ruby task will
then call this function with <tt>say_hello(who)</tt> expression.</p>

<p>You can think of the build context as the IRB workspace where
context scripts would be loaded, properties defined and Ruby tasks 
evaluated.</p>

<h2>Build inheritance</h2>

<p>From release <i>0.5.0</i>, Bee implements build inheritance. This
feature enables to extend one or more build files in another one, overwriting
properties and overloading targets. There can be no collision in properties
and targets of inherited build files. Note that a build file can be marked
as abstract which means that it must have been extended to run.</p>

<h3>Properties</h3>

<p>Build properties overwrite existing ones in parent build file. Thus,
let's say you write this parent build file:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-property-parent.yml"?>

<p>Then, in a son build file, you write:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-property-son.yml"?>

<p>We tell Bee that this script extends another one with <i>extends</i>
key in <i>build</i> entry. Furthermore, property <i>foo</i> is redefined
with new value <i>bar</i>.</p>

<p>Running extending build file will print:</p>

<?run command="bee -s ll:80 -f exp/userguide-property-son.yml test"
      print="bee test"?>

<h3>Targets</h3>

<p>Targets are not replaced with those you define in extending build,
but overloaded instead. This means that a target you define in an 
extending build file will be called, but this target can call same 
target defined in parent build using <i>super</i> in a script.</p>

<p>Let's consider this parent build file:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-target-parent.yml"?>

<p>We extend it with:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-target-son.yml"?>

<p>Running extending build will display:</p>

<?run command="bee -s ll:80 -f exp/userguide-target-son.yml test"
      print="bee test"?>

<p>Thus, calling super, you can patch existing target, adding tasks
before and/or after running parent target. Not calling super, you can
overwrite parent target altogether.</p>

<p>Default targets are appended with inheritance. Thus, if parent build
file <i>A</i> defines target <i>a</i> as default target and <i>B</i>
defines <i>b</i> as default target, then a build file that extends
<i>A</i> and <i>B</i> would have <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> as default
targets. Furthermore, if a given build file defines default targets,
it overrides default ones in parents. Thus if previous build file that
extends <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> defines its own default targets, it will
ignore those defined by parents.</p>

<p>Behavior is similar for aliases : they are appended (for a given entry)
and overridden by aliases in extending build file.</p>

<h3>Inheritance Usage</h3>

<p>Build inheritance is very handy when all your projects share a
common structure and thus should have a common build file. You can
write this common build file as a parent for children that will
customize it in each project. This is a way to enforce a standard but
add flexibility by specialization.</p>

<p>You can also use inheritance to assemble specialized build files to
perform specific targets. For instance, you might write a build file
to build your distribution archive, another one to manage your Python
code, another one to manage your release (tagging project and sending
emails), and so on. Your project would then assemble these parts
extending them and behaving as a scheduler to perform the job.</p>

<p>Let's say you want to build all you projects in the 'build'
directory and always write the same code to clean this directory.
You might use the following file as a parent build file:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-inheritance-parent.yml"?>

<p>You would use this parent in your build file writing:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-inheritance-son.yml"?>

<p>This build file overwrites the <i>build</i> property with appropriate
value <i>target</i> and uses the <i>clean</i> target to delete build
directory and delete generated files.</p>

<p>To avoid name collisions between build files, you should use prefixes
on property and target names. For instance, in a parent build file
named <i>python.yml</i>, you could prefix the property and target names
with <i>py</i> so that <i>py_src</i> would not collide with another
named <i>java_src</i> for instance.</p>

<h2>Editors integration</h2>

<p>Here are quick hacks to use Bee in Emacs and Eclipse. Please feel
free to contribute any improvement or any editor or IDE integration, 
it will be integrated or listed in next release.</p>

<h3>Emacs</h3>

<p>Here is a piece of configuration to put in your <i>.emacs</i> file
to integrate Bee in Emacs:</p>

<?include file="exp/userguide-emacs.el"?>

<p>To run a compilation, hit <tt>F6</tt>. The mini-buffer prompts for a target
to run (you can browse history hitting up or down arrows). Then hit 
<tt>ENTER</tt> to run the build. Build file is searched recursively, thus
you can launch build from any buffer in your project. Note that you can
also use target prompt to type any command line option. For instance, to
get help about current build, type <i>-b</i> as command line option.</p>

<h3>Eclipse</h3>

<p>A simple way to integrate Bee in Eclipse is to use <i>External Tools</i>
menu. Click on <i>External Tools...</i> item in this menu and the following
dialog box will appear:</p>

<center><img src="userguide-eclipse-bee.png"></center>

<p>This configuration will launch Bee in the project home directory, which
is a reasonable guess in much cases. You may have to adjust Bee location
path according to your configuration.</p>

<p>Following configuration will ask for the task to run, opening a pop-up
where you can type it:</p>

<center><img src="userguide-eclipse-bee-task.png"></center>

<p>Running Bee this way will output build result in <i>Console</i> window:</p>

<center><img src="userguide-eclipse-bee-output.png"></center>

<h3>IntelliJ IDEA</h3>

<p>Bee can be easily integrated in IDEA as an external tool. Open settings
(in menu <b>File/Settings</b>) and add a new tool with the <b>+</b> button.
You can add an entry to start Bee with default target with following 
settings:</p>

<center><img src="userguide-idea-bee.png"></center>

<p>To add an entry that opens a dialog to prompt for target to run:</p>
