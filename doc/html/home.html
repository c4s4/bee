<p>Bee is a build tool running YAML files. These build files have a 
clean syntax Ã  la Ant and run as fast as make. They are made of shell
commands, Ruby code or Bee tasks for platform independent builds.</p>

<p>Hello World example looks like this:</p>

<? include file="exp/home-hello-world.yml" ?>

<p>This is that simple!</p>

<p>To start using bee within 15 minutes, type <tt>gem install bee</tt>
and read <a href="quickstart.html">Quick Start</a> section in this
documentation.</p>

<p><i>Enjoy!</i></p>
